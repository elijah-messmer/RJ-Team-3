        <p class="lead">While the RISE program in the federal district court for Massachusetts has been a successful alternative to incarceration and a path to rehabilitation for some, restorative justice has a long way to go before becoming a large-scale solution to the problem of mass incarceration. Resources are limited, skeptics are common and few get chances to participate. Yet advocates remain hopeful as they confront a criminal justice system that’s badly broken.</p>

                <p class="graph">For everything from non-violent drug offenses to homicide, the U.S. justice system has one broad tool to address crime: incarceration. Thanks in part to the War on Drugs and mandatory minimum sentencing, the U.S. prison population has increased 500% over the past 40 years. 
                    According to <a href="https://www.sentencingproject.org/research/">The Sentencing Project</a>, there are two million people in U.S. prisons and jails. The U.S. accounts for just 5% of the global population but more than 20% of the world’s prison population, according to the <a href="https://www.aclu.org/issues/smart-justice/mass-incarceration">American Civil Liberties Union</a>. Yet  surveys show that the fear of crime continues to increase even as we lock more people up each year. Perhaps most disturbingly, even victims aren’t satisfied with incarceration as a tool to address crime. According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 52% of all violent victimizations were left unreported to the police between 2006 and 2019.
                    “In the richest nation in the world, with arguably the largest and most expensive criminal justice system in human history, the majority of people who survive violence prefer nothing to everything we have to offer,” wrote Danielle Sered in her book, “Until We Reckon: Violence, Mass Incarceration, and a Road to Repair.” Sered is the founder of Common Justice, a restorative justice program in Brooklyn.
                    “If you think about the way our criminal legal system currently works, there is little to no room within the structure of a court case for the victims,” said Susan Maze-Rothstein, the co-director of the Center for Restorative Justice at Suffolk University. “They are relegated to the role of witness. Arguably, [incarceration] is more retraumatizing because people are left with their harm and their pain.”
