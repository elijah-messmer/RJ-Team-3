		<p>Fire incidents can have devastating consequences, causing property damage, injuries, and loss of life. As a result, cities around the world invest significant resources in fire prevention and response. In the city of Boston, the fire department responds to an average of 40,000 incidents per year, ranging from small fires to major emergencies.
			In this project, I will analyze data from the Boston Fire Incident Reporting System for the period from April 2, 2022, to April 1, 2023. By exploring the patterns and trends in fire incidents, I wish to provide insights that can inform fire prevention strategies and improve emergency response in the city.</p>
			<h2>Data analysis</h2>
				<p>We conducted an exploratory analysis of the fire incidents in Boston from April 2, 2022 to April 1, 2023. The dataset contained information on the date, time, location, and type of each fire incident.</p>
				<p>The fire incident data used in this analysis was obtained from the <a href="https://data.boston.gov/dataset/fire-incident-reporting" target="_blank">Boston Fire Department</a>. The data includes information on the date, time, location, and cause of each fire incident that occurred during the selected time period.</p>
				<h3>1. Number of fires in each neighbor in Boston</h3>

				var ctx = document.getElementById('myChart').getContext('2d');
				var chart = new Chart(ctx, {

			<p>The data collected between April 2, 2022, to April 1, 2023 reveals that the neighborhoods of Boston, Charlestown, and Roxbury were the areas most affected by fires. The incidence of fires in these areas was significantly higher than other neighborhoods in the Boston region.</p>
			<p>information highlights the need for increased fire prevention measures in these neighborhoods, such as the installation of fire alarms and smoke detectors, regular fire safety inspections, and improved building codes. Local authorities should also consider targeted outreach and education campaigns to raise awareness of fire prevention practices among residents in these areas.</p>
			<p>This information could be useful for fire prevention efforts, such as increasing inspections or staffing during weekdays. Distribution of Fire Incidents by Time of Day. Next, we looked at the distribution of fire incidents across different times of the day. As shown in the line chart below, the majority of incidents occurred between 12 PM and 10 PM, with the highest concentration between 2 PM and 6 PM.</p>


<h3>2. Count of alarms and estimated property loss in different neighborhoods</h3>

<div id="my_dataviz"></div>
<p>This scatter plot shows that Dorchester is the neighborhood with the highest property damage caused by fire, and it also has the highest residential population. Boston has the highest number of fire alarms reported. In contrast, Harbor Islands has the lowest incidence of fire, the smallest population, and the least amount of property damage caused by fire.</p>



<h3>3. Count of alarms in day of times</h3>
<div id="line_chart"></div>
<p>In this graph, we can see that the number of fire alarms is relatively average throughout the year, with only one day, February 5, 2023, showing a peak. So I looked up the news about the fire that day. <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/02/05/metro/grease-fire-brookline-restaurant-displaces-family/">Boston Globe</a> reported: “A two-alarm grease fire at a Brookline restaurant displaced one family and caused streets to be shut down for hours”. And at about 3 p.m., Brookline police said on Twitter that the Brookline Fire Department was “investigating heavy smoke” at the rear of 1398 Beacon St. The tweet added that there were shutdowns on the outbound side of Beacon Street at Harvard and Center streets, and that Winchester Street was closed. Police asked the public to avoid the area. Therefore, it can be assumed that the fire was large and occurred in a public area, so it was seen by many people and reported to the police. But this is only my speculation.</p>

<h3>The most frequent time and month for fire incidents</h3>

<p>The fourth visualization is a bar chart that displays the number of fire alarm calls per month and per hour. It shows that displays the number of fire alarms reported in each month and each hour of the day over the past year. The chart reveals that the frequency of fire alarms in February was the highest of all months, likely due to the large fire at the Brookline restaurant as discussed earlier. Additionally, the data shows that the months of July and August had the highest number of fire alarms reported. Interestingly, the chart also displays a higher frequency of fire alarms being reported during midday and afternoon hours compared to morning and evening hours.This pattern could be attributed to more activities taking place during the day, such as cooking, heating, and using electrical appliances.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall, despite the project's shortcomings in terms of small data volume, it still provides valuable insights into fire safety issues in Boston and demonstrates the potential of data visualization to increase public awareness and promote preventive measures. In the future, the project could be expanded by incorporating additional data sources and exploring more sophisticated visualization techniques.</p>
